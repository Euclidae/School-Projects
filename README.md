# 🎓 The "I Actually Remembered to Upload These" School Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of academic greatest hits! This repo is like my digital backpack - containing the assignments I actually remembered to push to GitHub before they got lost in the void of my hard drive. 

## 📚 What's Inside?

A delightful mishmash of projects in:
- Python (for when readability counts)
- C (for when we're feeling nostalgic about memory management)
- C++ (because why not have the best/worst of both worlds?)

## 🤔 Project Highlights

This repository contains some school projects that managed to survive my "I should probably save this somewhere" phase. Consider this the "best of" album - not because they're necessarily the best, but because they're the ones that made it to version control.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

If you're wondering "Where's [specific project]?" - it's probably:
1. Lost to the great hard drive in the sky
2. Buried in one of thousands of local files
3. Still sitting in some long-forgotten Git branch
4. All of the above

## 🚀 Usage

Feel free to explore, but remember: these are school projects. They work (mostly), but they're more "learning experience" than "production ready." No warranty expressed or implied!

## 📝 Note

This is not a complete portfolio of my academic work. It's more like a "greatest hits" album where "greatest" means "I actually remembered to commit these."

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug in my homework from two years ago? Cool story! But since these are school projects, I'm keeping them in their natural habitat - slightly imperfect but functional.

## 📜 License

Feel free to use these for educational purposes! Just remember:
- These are school projects
- They were made for learning
- They might not be the most elegant solutions
- But hey, they worked for the grade! 🎉
